## 🎯 Project Overview

In this project, I created a dynamic and insightful dashboard to monitor **credit card transactions**, **customer trends**, and **revenue performance** over time.  
Key tasks included:
- Connecting Power BI with a PostgreSQL database
- Cleaning and transforming data using SQL
- Writing DAX measures for KPIs
- Designing a professional Power BI dashboard
- Sharing insights via a video demo and presentation

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- 🐘 PostgreSQL (Data storage & SQL queries)
- 📊 Power BI (Dashboard & Data modeling)
- 🧮 DAX (Calculated columns & measures)
- 📂 Excel (Raw data import)
- 🎥 OBS Studio / Screen Recorder (Demo video)

## 📥 Import Data from SQL Database

I imported credit card transaction data directly from a **PostgreSQL database** into Power BI.  
Using SQL queries, I created views and transformed raw data for analysis.

✅ Benefit: Whenever the PostgreSQL data updates, Power BI reflects the changes automatically through **live connectivity**.

---

## ⚙️ Data Processing & DAX Queries

I used **SQL** for:
- Creating tables and views
- Filtering weekly data
- Grouping by customer, income level, and date

Then in **Power BI**, I applied **DAX formulas** for:
- Weekly revenue calculation
- Previous vs current week comparison
- % growth KPIs
- Customer segmentation

---

## 📊 Dashboard Design & Key Insights

The dashboard includes:
- Total Revenue, Transaction Count, and Customer Count (with week-over-week % changes)
- KPIs by Income Group
- Daily transaction trends
- Top-performing cities
- Customer engagement visualization

### 📈 Key Insights:
- Total Transaction Amount increased by **24.67%**
- Total Transaction Count increased by **19.34%**
- Customer Count grew by **11.47%**
- Peak transactions occur on **Saturday**
- Most spending customers belong to **Upper class** income group

---

## 📤 Export & Share

The final dashboard is exported in the following formats:
- `.pbix` (Power BI file)
- `.pptx` (Presentation)
- `.mp4` (Live working video)
- Screenshot images

These help to present and share insights effectively.
